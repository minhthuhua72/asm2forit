            <h3>Overview</h3>
            <p><br>
                Realizing that there is a lack of knowledge about recycling in Vietnam, I have come 
                up with an idea to incorporate waste management into mobile applications, which will 
                be available for cross-platform, both Android and iOS. On the whole, the aim of this 
                project is to develop a real-time 2D objects detection on a reactive smartphone app 
                that will quickly identify and categorize recycling trash. After that, the app tells 
                the users to know which trash bins will be used to throw rubbish away. There are also 
                features to enhance users' experiences, including a QR code scanner in case of the 
                object detection cease to function, a record of recycling activities, and a list of 
                recycling locations based on the phone GPS.

            <h3>Motivation</h3>
            <p><br>
                First of all, I have studied abroad in Calgary, Canada for three years and I remembered 
                how amazingly their waste-sorting robot worked at the mall. In particular, the recycling 
                robot is known as Oscar, which used artificial intelligence to classify trash into the 
                corresponding waste bins. As a result, the idea has come to my mind that it will be very 
                utilitarian if we have a smartphone app that works pretty much like Oscar. Secondly, 
                according to the Ministry of Natural Resources and Environment, each family in Vietnam 
                uses up to one kilogram of plastic bags each month. Therefore, big cities like Hanoi and 
                Ho Chi Minh City can discharge up to 80 tons of plastic trash into the environment. Moreover, 
                the majority of trash will be buried or sent to landfills due to the inefficient classification 
                recycling trash, in which people have difficulties to remember and figure out the suitable bins 
                for each type of garbage. Furthermore, there are some cases that the trash does not fit in any 
                category illustrated on the trash bin, which leads to people either mixing up the trash or 
                throwing them in the random waste carts. As a consequence, these actions have ended up with a 
                polluted and contaminated environment as it will be very time-consuming to sort trash out. Hence, 
                I believe this project will simplify and save time on the process of recycling. In addition, it 
                will have a positive impact on the environment because the more people use the app, the more 
                garbage will be recycled, and the project also offers to acknowledge people about waste disposal 
                and what they can do to protect the environment.

            <h3>Description</h3>
            <p><br>
                The first and foremost feature I would like to develop is a real-time object detection that 
                is used to differentiate garbage and sort them into the following categories: organic waste, 
                recyclable, and non-recyclable. In specific, the feature mainly focuses on dealing with 2D 
                objects because 3D detection can be very challenging to carry out as there is a lack of 
                diverse datasets within a category. In addition, this feature is significantly inspired by 
                the iPhone's camera which has a good reputation for its face recognition so I think that it 
                will be a brilliant idea to incorporate object detection into smartphone applications. 
                Therefore, people will be able to recognize the recycling trash and highlight their 
                characteristics in real time. For instance, say you buy a cup of iced coffee from Highlands. 
                It is obvious that they will serve your beverage in a cup with a lid and a straw, all in 
                plastics. However, after you have finished drinking, you might not know if everything you use 
                is recyclable so you use the object detection via camera feed and it will return with the result 
                like "Recyclable but remember to remove the liquid". At the same time, the screen background will 
                turn blue to tell you the respective bin which is for recycling trash. As a result, you know exactly 
                where to throw your trash away and save more time rather than looking left and right to locate the 
                right waste bins. Overall, a real-time 2D object detection is expected to work by training through 
                an open-source software library for machine learning like Google Tensorflow, which is based on the 
                proposed paperworks like Scaled-YOLOv4: Scaling Cross Stage Partial Network.<br><br>

                The second feature of the product that I would like to build is a QR code scanner. What I expect 
                from the input is that every item that we use daily will have a QR code printed on the objects where 
                it is the most visible, such as on the milk container’ package or the bottle’s cap. The QR code provides 
                further information about materials that make up the product and whether it is recyclable or not. 
                Therefore, whenever you want to dispose of the trash, all you need to do is use this feature to scan 
                and read the code, then the app displays information on the screen either "Recyclable" or "Non-recyclable". 
                Subsequently, the application changes the colour of its background corresponding to the colour of the waste bin. 
                Additional information to colours of trash cans, green representing organic wastes, such as food or drink, whereas 
                blue stands for recycling bin, and black bins are used for the remaining rubbish. This feature is an alternative 
                to the 2D objects detection in case of malfunctions and it only works best for those items that can be printable 
                on the packaging. Let’s take an example of a can of Coca-Cola having a QR code apparently displayed on the surface. 
                By scanning the QRcode, users are able to indicate whether the can is recyclable or not, and acquire further 
                information about materials made up of this product. In this case, the app will let the users know that the 
                Coca-Cola can is recyclable because it is made of 42% recycled aluminum and 56% new aluminum. As a result, 
                it is now the users’ duty to throw the can into the right bin corresponding to the recyclable.<br><br>

                The third feature I would like to add to the project is a dashboard called "Your activity". In essence, 
                it keeps track of the users’ activities and informs the number of times people use the app daily and the 
                average amount of disposed waste each day. The data will depend on QR codes users scan or how many times 
                the object detection succeeds to identify recycling trash. Later on, the app can aggregate data to give 
                users an insight into what extent they have done to save the environment. Similar to when you bring your 
                own bottle to get water from the fountain at RMIT, it tells you how many disposable plastic bottles you 
                have saved through using it. I believe that this feature will motivate people to become more involved in 
                recycling because it gives people a sense of reward by showing their accomplishment to save the environment.<br><br>

                Last but not least, this project will include a list of nearby recycling centers, which are based on the 
                phone location. Therefore, it is impossible if there is no GPS involved which will be used to identify the 
                exact location. This feature mainly focuses on detecting the specialized centers dealing with hazardous 
                wastes, like harmful chemicals, or drop-off recycling centers for electronics. This is because it requires 
                a more complicated process to actually recycle these types of items. For example, batteries which are 
                commonly used for everyday gadgets like TV remotes. These batteries are recyclable, however, they need 
                to hand in to specialists of recycling electronics because batteries made of cobalt and lead, which can 
                contaminate the Earth if they are not disposed properly. Therefore, it is very important for users to use 
                first and second features to identify the recyclable garbage and figure out where to send them to.

            <h3>Tools & Technologies</h3>
            <p><br>
                As mentioned above, this smartphone app will be developed on the cross platform, both Android and iOS, 
                which means that there will be two programming languages involved, in which Android apps will use Java 
                programming language, whereas Swift is used for iOS. Therefore, different softwares can be installed in 
                order to create this app. On the one hand, Android Studio is a system software that is used to build any 
                Android apps and the most important thing to know that it is an open source, which means it is available 
                for any developers to download and work on many platforms. On the other hand, Xcode is the perfect 
                software to write Swift and build an iOS app, however, it can only be installed on Apple's operating 
                system. In other words, even though Xcode is free and open source, it is only available to download 
                from Mac App Store. Besides, in order to build a 2D object detection, it is inevitable to involve 
                machine learning like Google Tensorflow software to train models.

            <h3>Required Skills</h3>
            <p><br>
                Based on the current skills and the minimal knowledge about artificial intelligence along with machine 
                learning that I have, I believe that carrying out this project will be very challenging and somewhat 
                not feasible. Therefore, I have broken down into smaller tasks that I am able to do in order to increase 
                the practicability of this project. The foremost skill that I need is cross-platform app development 
                in which it is essential to learn Java and Swift programming languages in order to turn my ideas into 
                reality. This can be done through program electives at RMIT such as mobile application development and 
                I expect that this course will cover the open-source softwares supporting those programming languages. 
                Moreover, I find that there are some relevant skills, including database management and UI/UX, also 
                offered by RMIT program electives so it is not really difficult to acquire these skills, yet they will 
                consume lots of time to master. Furthermore, it is essential for me to become proficient in mathematics 
                and statistics to deal with algorithms due to the involvement of machine learning in this project. It is 
                also important for me to understand the process of training a model, in which I need to establish the 
                development environment, collect training datasets together with test data, configure and train the 
                model, convert the trained model to TensorFlow, and eventually test the model in a mobile application.

            <h3>Outcome</h3>
            <p><br>
                The most significant outcome of this development is its positive impact on the environment, which not 
                only influenced people like us, but also the natural habitat of animals. The more trash that can be 
                recycled, the fewer toxic chemicals and greenhouse gases released to the environment, which slows down 
                global warming so that the habitats of polar bears or penguins will be preserved. In addition, while 
                people are able to minimize the exploitation of raw materials by reprocessing products with recycling 
                materials, the rainforests will be saved from deforestation. For people like us, there will be a save of 
                space owing to the fewer landfills existing and we could save more money on manufacturing products as raw 
                materials cost more than the recycling material and they might be only used once. As a result, this project 
                has a majority of positive effects on human lives and society, besides the time investment to develop a 
                perfectly-working 2D object detection, which can also be used to leverage 3D object detection.
