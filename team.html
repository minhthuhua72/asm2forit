            <h3>Team Name</h3>
            <p><br>
                The name that I would like to give to my group is “into the unknown” because it illustrates the idea that members have never been familiar with each other before and we will never know what to expect. Therefore, it will be very fascinating to get to know and learn about each of my teammates.

            <h3>Team Profile</h3>
            <p><br>
                Up to this point, I have teamed up with a student and it is our goal to look for two more members. Despite the fact that we could make a team of five, we believe that it is better to work in a group of four because there will be less conflicts coming up during the progress. First of all, there is only a member in my team and his name is Khoa. I have learned from Khoa that he is very good at listening as he is always willing to hear my thoughts and needs, which can make us a great pair to work together. In particular from the Big Five Test, I am above average level of agreeableness, which tells that I always make sure that my ideas are heard in the team. Therefore, having a peer who will be interested in listening smoothes out the process of working in a team. However, I also find that his English usage is quite limited, especially when it comes to technical writing, which concerns me about whether he could perform well for the next assignment or not. Yet, he shows a sense of creativity through his interest in graphic designs leading to my decision to team up with him since I intend to look for a teammate with outside of the box thinking. This is because my level of openness to experience is pretty low compared to other traits, which related to the level of creativity. Therefore, I would like to make sure that I am in a team of people with innovative ideas and solutions so I could lean on them to some extent. Unfortunately, I am in need of two more members and if possible, I would like to have a female fellow in the team. The reasons why I want to have a female member is that it will balance the  gender within the team and also minimize my sense of being in the minority. Therefore, when it comes to decision-making, there will be no choices that are prone to masculine interests, resulting in team members can work together on the project which they share common interest in. Furthermore, it allows us to bring out the best performance since no one will have difficulties dealing with tasks that do belong to their fields. Moreover, I am a kind of person who is very task-oriented so my expectation for the last member is that he or she could do all the best to finish the work properly. I do not mind either collaborating with other people or working by myself as long as the team members commit to the work then I could help with other things like proofreading or editing.
