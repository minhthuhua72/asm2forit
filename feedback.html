            <h3>Feedback</h3>
            <p><br>
                In my opinion, feedback is a means to help me revise my work before submission. As I tend to write a lot for a report so there are times that I will not look back at my work to check for 
                grammar errors or format issues. Therefore, feedback offers me an insight into some sections that needed further adjustment. For example, one of the students leaves me a comment on how I 
                use the first point of view too often, which makes the report subjective as it greatly depended on my personal opinions.However, I feel that I can justify the use of the first point of 
                view in this report by saying that there are sections asking for my opinion like “How will this affect you?”. As a result, it is unavoidable to use “I” to answer the questions, yet, I will 
                go back to those sections, proofread, and figure out what her point is by saying so. If I find out somewhere needed to edit, I can immediately resolve the issues, which saves me a lot of time 
                reading through the report as I do not need to read from the start.

            <p>
                The other effect is that people, who provide feedback, demonstrate how comprehensible the report is from the readers’ points 
                of view and perspective as IT fellows. This is because they need to understand what I would like to express so that they can provide corresponding suggestions to my report. Otherwise, it might 
                show that my report is off the track and I need to make some changes. At the same time, I could improve the performance by taking their responses into the report. In particular, I spend lots of 
                time paraphrasing the information to avoid plagiarism and minimize the number of references that I need to cite. Despite my effort to do so, there will be some facts that cannot be fully expressed 
                in my own words, such as terminology, which might lead to plagiarism. As a result, the student advised that I should include more academic sources in the reference as well as the drawings that needed 
                to clarify in the appendix. By doing so, I would know what are essentials that should include in technical writing and what are mistakes to avoid. As a result, my report can minimize the chances of 
                plagiarism as well as I learn to improve my technical writing skill for the other assignment.

                The other advantage of feedback is that it is an estimation of my knowledge level. For example, the student indicates the possibility to carry out the 2D object detection feature in the project. As a beginner 
                to this major, I have not acquired enough knowledge together with information to indicate whether it is absolutely practical or not. By receiving feedback from an experienced fellow, I start to doubt the potential 
                of this development and make further research to prove that it is likely to execute. Along the process of researching, I acquired further information to consolidate my idea, whether the feedback is wrong or right. 
                In this case, I agree with the student that 2D object detection on the smartphone app is still unfamiliar to lots of people in Vietnam because this technology has not been widely applied to daily applications. 
                In addition, it will be costly to develop from scratch as well as a lack of local specialists in this field. However, this feature is still feasible to develop but it will require a great commitment in research and 
                financial investment to make this possible. Last but not least, feedback like “it is well done” or “I really like” significantly motivates me to keep on working, in which people provide their opinions on what they like about my work or how good the performance 
                is. It encourages me in the way that I feel the reward for the effort that I make, and thus, I am willing to dedicate myself to enhance the quality of work.
